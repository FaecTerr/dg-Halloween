# Duck Game Halloween Event
As of the recent events and the possible Duck Game's delisting from Steam in sight, I want to release this mod's source code to the public domain. I've retired from duck game, but I don't want this to be lost.

This is Steam version of the mod. `Dev` version of the mod exists, but not tested enough.
Known bug: Placing beartrap near walls might result into other players thinking it is not eligible spot for trap, so it will appear and work in closed state, while the duck that placed it, will work in parallel universe where it works just fine.

I've dropped developing of this mod long time ago, expect dirty code in here.
